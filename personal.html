            Hello there, this is Min ThuKha. I created this webpage to share my
            experience on coding and how I develop skills to create a webpage.
            Before I begin , I have something to let you guys know in advance ,
            I don't have a degree for a particular field nor a certificate for
            web developing, I am just a learner like you guys.

          I created this webpage to tell my journey on how i started with
          programming and what did I do to understand what I am understanding
          now. No more description about myself and let's keep this short as
          much as possible.

            If you are new to this computer programming you might be wondering
            where to edit your codes. Don't worry , download Visual Studio Code
            it will allow you to run any programming languages on it. Here is
            how to download it -

        <div class="text-third-row">
          To create a webpage you need a code editor and 3 essential programming
          languages . Those 3 programming languages are HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript. Don't worry, even if you have never heard about it before,
          I will give you a short description on it and you can learn those
          programming languages from the link below. Let's think about building
          a house, when we build a house the first thing we would do is building
          the structure until it looks like a house. When it is done, we would
          move onto painting the walls, placing furnitures and desinging the
          interior, only then it looks like a house.The same goes for creating a
          web, we need a structure and some designs to make it look like a web.
          In this case we use HTML for the structure of the web and CSS to
          design the structure until it looks like a web.<br />
          <span style="color: red">For example: </span>
        </div>
        <div classs="third-row-example">
          <p>We use HTML to build the button:</p>
          <div class="images3">
            <img src="/images/ss.png">
            <img src="/images/ss2.png">
          </div>
          <p>We use Css to design it:</p>
          <div class="images4">
            <img src="/images/css.png">
            <img src="/images/cssr.png">
          </div>
        </div>

        <div id="WTL" class="forth-row">
          <div class="forth-text-row">
            <p>
              If you understand those two programming languages you can build a
              webpage but you still need to know a bit of Javascript. This is where
              I have been learning about programing languages, It is very useful and
              it will provide whatever you need to know from HTML to JavaScript.

            Trust me,You don't have to learn or memorize every single codes.The
          more you do , the more you will understand, if i have to give an advise,
          pls go through one at a time.You don't have to go through everything in it , the web itself is so specific that you might get bored after a time period  if you are not really a reader .

            <p>If you wanna watch and learn , youtube is the best option for it. YouTube can be very handy when you know how to use it. I started from YouTube , I prefer to watch and listen rather than reading and that is why I started from Youtube. If we are on the same boat try learning from Youtube. These are some example videos that you can go watch on Youtube , it may be more than an hour video but trust me they are all worth your time.

          <p>I have been learning those programing languages from both Youtube & W3Schools , both provide whatever I need to know to develop a webpage , so I took it as a benefit and study from both platforms. Personally I think Youtube is the best among , despite both being nifty. However I would take notes from W3School and jump back into Youtube to understand more about particular topic. I would combine my knowledge from both platforms and create something out of it. You can use my method if you wish to , because learning from  different places can provide you more knowledge rather than sticking to a place .  Good things take time , don't rush you might miss the principal rules. GoodLuck with your Journey on learning how to create a website , I wish you the best. </p>
